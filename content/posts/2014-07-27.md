>The population at large is, statistically speaking, not very bright. Many are deranged from overuse of alcohol or drugs. A big number are simply aging elderly rooted in USSR-centric mindset who never adjusted to the modern world.

Being dependent their whole life on government help, they are psychologically unable even to think government can do something wrong.

>Garman said, "go". Larson gave a thumbs-up. (He later said he was too scared to form words.) So Bales answered, "go", Flight Director Gene Krantz said "go", and capsule communicator Charlie Duke passed it up to the crew. At MIT, where we realized that something mysterious was draining time from the computer, we were barely breathing.

#### Weekly notes

* Russia - if you have a blog, or a personal site of some sorts (or a LiveJournal account), and your daily traffic is over 3k (unique?) visitors a day, you must register with a state registry. Brand new [law (in russian)](http://iamblogger.ru/law97/) brings plenty of responsibilities, but doesn't provide much of rights for the "bloggers". You also must specify your real life name and contact info for "judicial inquiries".
* Fairly common in London exclamation Ta! according to the Urban Dictionary is actually [dutch](http://fr.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TA).

>Most people do not realize that the English language roots are really Danish or Jutland. Equiped with this knowledge this word is easy to decipher.

* Did a presentation on the latest London ReactJS meetup. It was nice, about half an hour. Got a bit lost while demonstrating the source code of the app not written by me. Note for the future - make more comments in the code which you intend to demonstrate during the talk.
* Got one great advice from [@charypar](http://twitter.com/charypar) before the talk - "Always think that audience badly wants you to succeed." The very same advice works in life too.
* Have a great start of the week!
