####Read
* Story by TheGuardian on Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde, [currently](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/05/sp-pirate-bay-cofounder-peter-sunde-in-prison) serving in Swedish prison. He is vegan too.
* David Graeber is [pondering](https://libcom.org/library/phenomenon-bullshit-jobs-david-graeber) the phenomenon of bullshit jobs. It seems that people could legitimately work less in the year 2014, but for some reason this doesn't happen.

####Watch

* John Cleese - How to inspire creativity within yourselves. This [lecture](http://tune.pk/video/3977274/john-cleese-how-to-inspire-creativity-within-yourselves) is dated 1991, but still as brilliant as it was 25 years ago.
* Timelapse from a [space](http://vimeo.com/111049676) station
* John Lewis Christmas [special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iccscUFY860)

####Play

* Internet Archive and their [collection](https://archive.org/details/internetarcade) of arcade games
* Spin Tires - simulation of getting your car [stuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiOt7SuHGPM) in the mud of Russian roads, and then getting the car out of the mud

####Personal notes

* First batch of the stereoscopic pictures from our trip to Scotland is now [available](https://www.flickr.com/photos/karismafilms/sets/72157648775217758/) for those, who possess red-cyan 3D glasses (or prefer [other](http://phereo.com/album/545d5f0ad475fe505c000390) means of watching 3D content).
* Going to participate in the upcoming Silicon [Milkroundabout](https://www.siliconmilkroundabout.com) on Sunday 16.11. If you are around, come to say hi. We are the badgers.
