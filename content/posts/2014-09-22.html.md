####Read

* Hands-on with Oculus' new devkit prototype. Codename - [Crescent Bay](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/20/6661525/oculus-crescent-bay-prototype-headset-hands-on), now with built-in headphones, more tracking sensors and something they call "new display technology". Also, here is a highly technical [keynote](http://youtu.be/nqzpAbK9qFk) by John Carmack on Oculus development, display technologies and action-to-photon time.
* Using smartwatches while driving is [illegal](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29238264) in UK and in terms of punishment equals to <= Â£100. Same fine is used for drivers who are busy talking on mobile phones without handsfree.
* The dude updates iOS on his 16Gb iPhone 5S. The phone [becomes](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2gxwd7/okay_this_sounds_insanely_stupid_but_i_updated_my/) 32Gb.
* Every fifth Londoner falls into a category of people who are employed but have no disposable income or savings. There is a word for those people - [Endies](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/11097161/Yuppies-flashed-the-cash-but-todays-Endies-have-to-watch-their-pennies.html).

####Personal notes

* I think hardware will become much cheaper or free very soon, the same way as software and internet services did. There is no single reason why there should be more expensive hardware to access internet services. Hardware will be cheap, and instead you will be farmed on your personal data, behaviour and content. If you think about it, once we solve the food and energy puzzles, the only credible currency will be quality content (or, well, entertainment).
* Noticed a curious thing while commuting on the bike through the busy streets of Clerkenwell and Shoreditch - people wearing branded breathing masks. There are also normal oxygen masks hospital-style which I've seen before, but branded ones looks pretty cool. Can you still breath normally while wearing it?
* I become mildly irritated when the person you're talking to is wearing headphones and refuses to take them off during the conversation. Curious about the same effect Google Glass might have on the other person, who is not wearing one.
