#### Read

* Long read on travel [photography](http://paulstamatiou.com/traveling-and-photography-part-1/) by [@Stammy](twitter.com/stammy) of Twitter
* I paid $25 for an Invisible [Boyfriend](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/01/22/i-paid-25-for-an-invisible-boyfriend-and-i-think-i-might-be-in-love/), and I think I might be in love. On the same topic, don't miss Ex Machina, now in cinemas.
* [Dark](http://joel.mn/post/108657860988/deep-web-marketplaces) Deep Web marketplaces research. How people buy things on the hidden side of the Internet.
* Google is going to disqualify [SHA-1](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/gradually-sunsetting-sha-1.html) SSL certificates and display warning symbol in Chrome instead of trusty green lock icon

#### Interact

* The Dawn Wall - new media [article](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/09/sports/the-dawn-wall-el-capitan.html?_r=0) by NYTimes, and a benchmark how to use WebGL in web storytelling

#### Listen

* How to Think Like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos - fresh [episode](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/01/20/elon-musk-and-jeff-bezos/) of Tim Ferris show podcast

#### Personal notes

* Just finished editing interview with radio astronomy professor Oleg Smirnov talking about Universe and Square Kilometer Array [project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Kilometre_Array) currently being prepared in South Africa and Australia. It was our first remote interview for the podcast, quite a different experience, but turned out really well in the end. We should do more. Interview will be live in the next episode of Radio Badger podcast.
* Thanks to [Clojure for the Brave](http://www.braveclojure.com/), I'm now hooked on Emacs. This weekend migrated my RSS subscriptions to GNUS, and looking forward to integrate Evernote. Also, they've got Tetris.
