####Personal notes

* Went to the Warner Bros studios at Leavesden to celebrate my birthday and check out Harry Potter props. Place itself is a bit in the middle of nowhere - a former war aerodrome where they used to construct bomber planes in WWII. Later WB turned airplane hangars into huge sound stages where they filmed all 8 movies. To get there you either get overground line to Watford Junction, or a train from Euston. Watford is still in Oyster zone, but that zone isn't even numbered - it is simply marked as 'special fares apply' on the very edge of tube map. From Watford there is shuttle bus service to the studios - proper Routemaster, of course. If you take a train it's not that bad actually - 15-20 min from Euston. Place itself is pretty remarkable, a must go for any movie geek - even if you're like myself not a huge fun of Harry Potter moviesation. It's pretty surreal to be there. And the way they get you inside the studio is very unexpected and simply magical. No spoilers here.
