####Personal notes

* Made it to the Shoreditch Old Station cafe, which is one of the few places around where you can spend your bitcoins. They couldn't charge me unfortunately - it seemed like they are using app on the phone for that, and the phone wasn't feeling good. They also had Futurecoins dispenser machine, which can convert cash into bitcoins. Tried that, worked brilliantly.

Have a nice fresh start of the year!
