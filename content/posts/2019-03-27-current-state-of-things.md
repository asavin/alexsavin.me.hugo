I wonder if my blog publishing pipeline still work, as the last blog post was about couple of years ago. Time flies.

Since then I've started a micro blog: [http://alexsavin.micro.blog/](http://alexsavin.micro.blog/). This is effectively my replacement for Twitter, as it is still maintaining open Web ideology, and is a nice place to be. Do subscribe, and let me know if you also have a micro blog - I'd be happy to follow you.

Ok now it is time to press publish and see if this ends up on my blog.
