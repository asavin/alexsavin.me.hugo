Suddenly there is this moment in your life when you find yourself at the Node JS conference in Budapest. One day single track event named One-Shot, with bunch of speakers and a nice variety of topics, complemented with great Kenyan coffee and Hungaryan craft beer. Organized by the local Javascript shop [Rising Stack](http://risingstack.com).

Some of the talks and slides are already available online, so I'll just go through some of those, worthy of your attention.

[Matteo Collina](https://twitter.com/matteocollina) did a rather brave [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qF_x_wGLl0) of live hacking on a Tessel - Node-compatible [microcontroller](https://tessel.io) with built-in wifi and a bunch of extension modules.

>What's the first thing you do, when you get a shiny new microcontroller? Make it blink the light.

There are a bunch of npm modules compatible with Tessel, which makes a great fun to hack on the hardware and make it do various things for you. Like blinking lights in a various fashion. As was expected, things didn't went smoothly, but Matteo managed to stay away from cursing and get things blinking (again).

[Mathias Buus](https://twitter.com/mafintosh) was venturing onto p2p side of the internet. After a short introduction to the technology behind torrents, Mathias demonstrated how easy it is to implement your own torrent client with Node, and even [stream](https://github.com/mafintosh/peerflix) video. But that was not enough - the next stop was infamous Docker with its (rather large)images. During the course of a spotless demo Mathias managed to share a Docker image via torrent, stream it on another machine, boot it and launch things. If you'd decide to launch Node, if would torrent-stream all the necessary files for a proper launch, but nothing else. And yes, you can do this too - the thing is named [Torrent Mount](https://github.com/mafintosh/torrent-mount) and allows you to mount a filesystem via torrent link.

Check his [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9knGfbHID8) (Docker demo starts at around 15 min), and [slides](https://mafintosh.github.io/slides/oneshot-budapest-2014/oneshot-budapest-2014.html#0).

[C J Silverio](https://twitter.com/ceejbot) told a story of something we all take for granted most of the days - npmjs registry. How it's all started as a small side CoachDB project and then miserably failed when the world suddenly start doing `npm install` way too often.

Watch how things [evolved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRitXorSH6M) for npm, becoming faster and more reliable (or check out [slides](https://github.com/ceejbot/scaling-registry-2014)).

Full list of talks is available on the Rising Stack YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1y9DvnoqqrNTJxvWrLJNYw). Ok, here is another worthy talk - [Design for Retry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjUMXmRH-6k) by [Aria Stewart](https://twitter.com/aredridel). She talks about something we all try to avoid - errors and how to design proper error handling in web apps.

Breaks were spiced by a special kind of cold brewed coffee, mixed with nitrogen. Yes, [nitro powered coffee](http://drinkroket.com) is a thing, and I'd love to taste it again next year.
