####Read

* If you ever wondered what airport security equipment can do to analog unprocessed film - Kodak got you [covered](http://wwwuk.kodak.com/global/en/service/tib/tib5201.shtml)

>X-ray equipment used to inspect carry-on baggage uses a very low level of x-radiation that will not cause noticeable damage to most films. However, baggage that is checked (loaded on the planes as cargo) often goes through equipment with higher energy X rays.

* [70 maps](http://www.vox.com/2015/2/17/7917165/maps-that-explain-america) that explain America. Or how to stop worrying and accept fact that most of the population on Earth are immigrants.
* Thoughts on [Keybase.io](http://blog.lrdesign.com/2014/03/thoughts-on-keybase-io/) service. Check the comments too. All in all, keybase.io is a very interesting step for the (cryptic) world of PGP encryption towards normal people.

####Watch

* Inside [Abbey Road](https://insideabbeyroad.withgoogle.com/en) studios - Google interactive tour on the legendary place in London
* [Blade Runner](http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/blade-runner-or-real-life) or real life? Project by BFI together with special screenings of the film.
* [SUNDAYS](https://vimeo.com/122325664) - sci-fi short film and proof of concept for the potential feature. I'd love to see that feature.

####Listen

* Codes that Changed the World - BBC Radio 4 project on [history](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05qqhqp/episodes/guide) of programming languages
* [Fresh episode](http://radiobadger.com/posts/2015-04-13.html) of Radio Badger podcast. Talks by me, Viktor Charypar and Robbie McCorkell on F8, aerospace grade tungsten, React Native, VR, basic income and Formula E in London.

####Personal notes

* Had a session in a local darkroom. Managed to process two rolls of 35mm film and print few frames. That's my first time back in a darkroom in probably 20 years or so. Also revived my [500px](https://500px.com/AlexanderSavin) account and uploaded scans of the prints there. 500px seems to evolved quite nicely, and offers much friendlier UI compared to the modern incarnation of Flickr for art pictures.
* As mentioned earlier, I started using Keybase.io service. My public key can be found [here](https://keybase.io/alexsavin) in case you want to send me encrypted email or something. I've also added PGP signature to all my emails now.
* Attending O'Reilly Fluent Conference next week. Will have few days to get around San Francisco. Happy to meet new people, so feel free to [ping me](https://twitter.com/karismafilms).
