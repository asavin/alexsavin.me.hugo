#### Read

* A guy goes to Cineworld cinema and (allegedly) attempts to do a screen rip of a film. In 3D. With a custom video camera rig he constructed. Staff calls the police. Guy denies everything. Judge [says](http://torrentfreak.com/student-not-guilty-in-first-3d-movie-piracy-case-150114/) there was absolutely no legal basis for the case.

#### Watch

* [365](https://vimeo.com/83155234) - one second of animation every day
* Trendy [Cafe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtLL30fO4gk)
* HTTPS [everywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBhZ6S0PFCY)
* Landing attempt of the Falcon [rocket](https://vine.co/v/OjqeYWWpVWK) on a sea drone ship.

>Close, but no cigar. This time.

#### Listen

* Radio Badger's first episode of this year is [live](http://radiobadger.com/posts/2015-01-16.html). Featuring very short and very special interview with Commander Chris Hadfield of the Canadian Space Agency.

#### Personal notes

* After testing SSL status of these pages with [SSLLabs](https://ssllabs.com) service turned out there were some problems with incomplete chain of certificates. Basically when you upload certificate to AWS, you have to specify all the intermediatory certificates in a correct order. I ended up creating a special certificate chain file, as was [instructed](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/InstallCert.html#SampleCert) by AWS docs, and now everything is fine. Should put everything into a blogpost at some point.
* It was snowing in London yesterday.
