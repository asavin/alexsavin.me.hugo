We're off to the epic trip in Russia, and I'm implementing a new season of the daily vlog. 5 episodes released so far, much more to go. You can follow our adventures on [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3fggrVyKDl9RiaRGiCC_rwsOYBxnaKsc). All new episodes are being added there daily.

This is the longest stretch of daily vlogs I've ever done.

Expect Saint-Petersburg, Cherepovets, Vologda region, small villages, countryside, trains, metro, super fast boats from USSR times, lots of coffee, vintage soviet arcade video machines and hunt for rare vintage film cameras.
