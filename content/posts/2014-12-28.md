Early Christmas morning is that rare moment when you can catch a glimpse of London without flocks of people around. Public transport is suspended, so only those owning a car or the most resilient tourists can make it to the downtown. And then you'll find peace, and that unusual feeling when you can freely walk around major attractions and take pictures, without disturbing anyone else. Well, maybe a few other photography fanatics like myself.

This photosession is highly inspired by [Robert Timothy](http://www.roberttimothy.com/empty-london) and his collection of empty London streets.

Full gallery can be found [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/karismafilms/sets/72157647606097663/) (also there you'll find full res pics). Also, full track of this photosession is recorded [here](http://www.strava.com/activities/232626620). Most of those 17km was done on a hired citybike, but St Paul's to Westminster part was performed on foot, since you can't legally take a bike across the Millenium Bridge.

Have a very happy festive season!
