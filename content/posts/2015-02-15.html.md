* How Canadian Spies [Infiltrated](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-canadian-spies-infiltrated-the-internets-core-to-watch-what-you-do-online) the Internet's Core to Watch What You Do Online. Fresh leaks from Ed Snowden. It's actually pretty smart idea of creating signatures for patterns of packets.

>Such technology works by observing small portions of internet traffic known as packets, and matching the information describing each packet against a library of signatures—including known applications, protocols, network activity, and more. Internet service providers have been known to use DPI technology to identify subscribers using peer-to-peer filesharing protocols such as BitTorrent on their networks, for example. But such devices, generally speaking, can do much, much more.

####Watch

* 10K timelapse [demo](https://vimeo.com/119343870) filmed with PhaseOne IQ180 camera. Obviously Vimeo doesn't support such resolutions (even 4K is only for Pro members), but the demo nicely zooms into the original footage.
* London Timescapes trailer on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/119159512), or in glorious 4K resolution on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-uHmGNk_34).

####Listen

####Personal notes
