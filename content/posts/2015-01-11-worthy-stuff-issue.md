 >The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. Am hoping to present that towards the end of this year. Good thing we didn't do it sooner, as we have learned a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon.

#### Personal notes

* This blog is officially migrated to be HTTPS only. The last tip was recent episode of ATP podcast, where they spoke about ways how HTTP traffic can be altered by free wifi networks - on board of an airplane in particular. I vaguelly recall some wifi networks embedding a huge banner on top of every page served via HTTP. Horrible thing to do, but one way to avoid this is to serve content via HTTPS - this way nothing (in theory) can interfere between your browser and original server.
* I also added Cloudfront distribution - basically a CDN that serves these pages to people from geographically most optimal location. People in US might notice a slight difference.
* Using Cloudfront actually provides you with a free HTTPS option. Catch is if you decide to use your custom domain - then you _have_ to buy your own certificate that belongs to your domain.
